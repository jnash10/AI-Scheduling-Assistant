    "# AI Meeting Scheduling Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a comprehensive AI-powered meeting scheduling system that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extracts meeting requirements** from input requests\n",
    "2. **Fetches calendar data** for all attendees for the next month\n",
    "3. **Uses LLM intelligence** to find optimal meeting slots\n",
    "4. **Handles conflicts** by identifying reschedulable meetings\n",
    "5. **Proposes final meeting schedules** with conflict resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "- Smart conflict detection and resolution\n",
    "- Semantic understanding of meeting importance\n",
    "- Priority-based scheduling (free slots first, then rescheduling)\n",
    "- Integration with Google Calendar API\n",
    "- Structured output format"

    "## 🎯 Improved Solution Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This enhanced AI Meeting Scheduling Solution now implements a **more practical and efficient approach**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Key Improvements Made:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **📅 Week-Based Calendar Fetching**: \n",
    "   - Only pulls calendar data for the relevant week (not full month)\n",
    "   - Much faster and more focused\n",
    "   - Reduces API calls and processing time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **⚡ Direct Conflict Resolution**: \n",
    "   - No alternative slot suggestions - just finds THE optimal solution\n",
    "   - LLM makes decisive choices about which meetings to reschedule\n",
    "   - Automatically resolves conflicts by prioritizing important meetings\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **🎯 Smart Prioritization**: \n",
    "   - **LOW PRIORITY** (will be rescheduled): lunch, coffee, casual calls, 1-on-1s, personal time\n",
    "   - **HIGH PRIORITY** (will be preserved): client meetings, presentations, large groups, interviews\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **📋 Updated Output with Resolution**: \n",
    "   - Shows exactly which conflicts were resolved\n",
    "   - Removes rescheduled meetings from attendee calendars\n",
    "   - Provides clear reasoning for decisions made\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Enhanced AI Intelligence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decisive Scheduling**: Makes firm decisions rather than just suggestions\n",
    "- **Context-Aware Prioritization**: Understands meeting importance from titles and content\n",
    "- **Conflict Resolution**: Directly handles scheduling conflicts without human intervention\n",
    "- **Efficient Processing**: Focused on relevant timeframe only\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **More Practical Workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load meeting request\n",
    "2. Fetch **week's calendar data only**\n",
    "3. AI **resolves conflicts automatically**\n",
    "4. Returns **final scheduled meeting** with conflicts handled\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ **Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster execution** (week vs month of data)\n",
    "- **Cleaner output** (no alternative suggestions)\n",
    "- **Automatic conflict resolution** (no manual intervention needed)\n",
    "- **Real-world practicality** (makes decisions like a human assistant would)\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution now works like a smart executive assistant that not only finds time slots but actually **makes the scheduling decisions** and **handles the conflicts**!"
